# What is this?

This is an example for teaching principles for good unit tests.

The branches of this repo contain different stages of the example. 

* _master_ contains examples of bad tests. They are not unit tests.
* _beispielloesungen_ contains suggestions for fixing some of those. For some of the examples, I have included alternative solutions.
